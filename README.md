# PIMLex
PIMLex is a high-performance learned index optimized with Processing-in-Memory (PIM) devices. 

## Requirements
Current implementation of PIMLex is based on [UPMEM](https://www.upmem.com/), which is a commercial available PIM device. To build this codeset, you need to install [UPMEM SDK](https://sdk.upmem.com/).


## Dependencies

- intel-tbb 2020.3
- jemalloc

## Building

Before starting the build, you need to specify `NR_DPUS` as the number of DPU modules on the machine and `NR_TASKLETS` as the number of threads used on PIM modules. For exmaple: 

```
NR_DPUS=512 NR_TASKLETS=12 make all
```

## Running

To obtain the throughput:

```
./bin/pimlex_host \
--keys_file={dataset} \ 
--total_num_keys= {dataset size} \ 
--init_num_keys={bulk load number} \  
--query_num= {test number} \ 
--sample_distribution={zipf, uniform}
```

To run different workloads, you can add additional flags:

- Search

```
--search
```

- Insert

```
--insert
```

- Range Query

```
--scan
```

- Mixed workload
```
--mix
```

- To use uniform distribution

```
--sample_distribution=uniform
```

- To use zipf distribution

```
--sample_distribution=zipf
```

All the result will be output to the csv file specified in --output_path flag. Without a workload flag, search-only workload is executed by default.

`test.sh` shows some test examples.


## Dataset

`books`, `osm` and `fb` are taken from [SOSD](https://github.com/learnedsystems/SOSD).

 `genome` and `planet` are taken from [GRE](https://github.com/gre4index/GRE).
